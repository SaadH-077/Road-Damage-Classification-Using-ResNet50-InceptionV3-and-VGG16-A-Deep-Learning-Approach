# Road-Damage-Classification-Using-ResNet50-InceptionV3-and-VGG16-A-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project focuses on developing a robust multi-label classification system to identify and categorize various types of road damage. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models—ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG16—we aim to automate the process of road damage detection from a dataset of 4000 TIF images, each labeled with 26 different damage types. The project explores the effectiveness of these models in accurately predicting damage severity on a scale of 0 to 5, enhancing road maintenance planning and resource allocation.

### Objectives:
Develop a Multi-Label Classification System: Use state-of-the-art deep learning models to predict multiple road damage types simultaneously.
Model Comparison: Evaluate the performance of ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG16 models, comparing their accuracy, precision, recall, and F2-score.
Visualize Results: Provide insightful visualizations including loss curves, confusion matrices, and a comparison of training metrics across models.

### Dataset:
- Images: 4000 TIF images of roads, each labeled with 26 damage types.
- Labels: Each damage type is rated on a scale of 0 to 5, indicating severity.

### Methodology:
- Data Preprocessing:
- Extract and process the road images and labels.
- Normalize images and resize them to the required input sizes for each model.

### Model Selection:
- ResNet50: Known for its deep residual architecture, which mitigates the vanishing gradient problem.
- InceptionV3: Utilizes auxiliary classifiers during training to improve gradient flow.
- VGG16: Characterized by its simplicity and depth, with 16 layers focusing on uniform convolutional layers.

### Training and Evaluation:
- Implement custom training loops for each model, tracking loss and evaluation metrics.
- Use CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer for effective training.
- Perform validation after each epoch and record accuracy, precision, recall, and F2-score.

### Visualizations:
- Loss Curves: Plot training and validation loss to observe convergence.
- Confusion Matrices: Analyze model performance on individual damage types.
- Training Metrics Comparison: Visualize accuracy, precision, recall, and F2-score across epochs for all models.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and layer freezing to optimize model performance.

### Deployment Potential:
- Discussed the application of the best-performing model in real-world scenarios, such as automated road inspections and maintenance scheduling.

### Results:
The project successfully trained and evaluated three deep learning models, achieving varying degrees of success in road damage classification.
ResNet50: Provided balanced performance across all metrics.
InceptionV3: Excelled in precision and F2-score, benefiting from its auxiliary classifiers.
VGG16: Delivered strong recall but required more computational resources due to its depth.

### Conclusions:
- Model Efficacy: Each model has strengths and weaknesses, with InceptionV3 showing the most promise in terms of precision and overall F2-score.
- Real-World Application: The findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning in automating road damage detection, offering a scalable solution for infrastructure management.

### Future Work:
- Unfreeze More Layers: Experiment with unfreezing additional layers in each model to potentially improve accuracy.
- Larger Datasets: Expand the dataset for training to improve model generalization.
- Deployment: Investigate the integration of the best-performing model into a mobile or web-based application for real-time road damage detection.
